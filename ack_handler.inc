  /**
   * Alters the add/edit form for an object to reflect realm permissions.
   *
   * It is up to the handler module to invoke this method as needed from
   * hook_form_alter().  Implementations of this method should modify the form
   * in such a way as to prevent users from creating objects in realms to which
   * they do not have access, or from changing the realm memberships of existing
   * objects.
   *
   * For example, if creating a node where access is granted via a list field,
   * the list field options should be modified to only show the realms where
   * the user has access to create the node.  If editing an existing node, the
   * list field should be disabled or hidden.
   *
   * In addition to this method, the handler module is responsible for enforcing
   * access to the delete button on the object's form (if one exists).  This is
   * typically done by setting '#access' => FALSE on the button element when the
   * user does not have delete access to any of the object's assigned realms.
   *
   * @param $object_type
   *   A string indicating the type of $object (e.g., node, menu_link).
   * @param $object
   *   The access-controllable object represented by this form.
   * @param &$form
   *   The form structure to alter.  This can be a full form structure, or a
   *   sub-element of a larger form.
   * @param &$form_state
   *   An associative array containing the current state of the form.
   * @param $form_id
   *   String representing the name of the form itself. Typically this is the
   *   name of the function that generated the form.
   * @param $realms
   *   An array of the realm values that the user is permitted to set on the
   *   object.  Typically, this list corresponds to the user's "create" access
   *   for the object.  If omitted, form elements that control realm membership
   *   will be locked (either '#disabled' => TRUE or '#access' => FALSE).
